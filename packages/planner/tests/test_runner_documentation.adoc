= Test runner

This project contains a simple test runner for Protractor Angular tests. The intention is to have an isolated test runner that does not share dependencies with code under test.
This test runner works standalone and needs to be pointed to a set of Typescript test specs and an URL to test them on.

NOTE: This test runner is for *black box tests* only.

== Preparing the test runner

The test runner installs it's own dependencies automatically. But you need to ensure the following prerequisites are met to prepare the Test Runner:

* Ensure that you have `node/npm` available in the current context.
* Curl and Bash are installed on your system and available in the path.
+
NOTE: You do not need to do npm install in the runner directory.

== Providing test specs

To run a test suite, you need to:

* Create a set of test specs (which may include page objects). The test specs source directory needs to include a `tsconfig.json` configuration file.
* Specify the path to the
spec source directory using the env variable `TEST_SOURCE_PATH`

== Running tests

To run the tests:

. Provide a URL of the system under test using the env variable `BASE_URL`. If
`BASE_URL` is not set, `http://localhost:8090/` is used.

. Run the tests with:
+
----
npm test
----
+
This will get all the local dependencies, compile the specs, add runtime dependencies and run the test specs. You can also specify a suite to run as the first argument.

== Additional configuration

The test runner supports the following environment variables to configure behavior:

|=======
|`BASE_URL` | URL of the system under test. Defaults to `http://localhost:8088/`.
|`ACCESS_TOKEN` | JWT Access Token to access the instance. Defaults to an example JWT token that can be used on local dev instances of OSIO.
|`TEST_SOURCE_PATH` | Path to the spec source directory. Defaults to the included examples in `example-test-src`.
|`TEMP_DIR` | Temporary directory for the test run. Defaults to a generated temporary directory.
|`SPECS_PATTERN` | File pattern for the Protractor run. This should never be modified/set.
|=======

The test runner uses a fixed set of dependencies defined in `package.json` of the test runner. The specs run with the same dependencies. If you need additional dependencies, you have to modify the test runner's
`package.json`.

== Test development

The access token given on the runtime environment is available to the test context through `browser.params.accessToken`. This can be utilized
to implement constructors for page objects like this:

----
constructor(login: boolean) {
  if (login) {
    console.log(browser.params.accessToken);
    let url = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(browser.params.accessToken)));
    browser.get(browser.baseUrl + "/?token_json=" + url);
  } else {
    browser.get(browser.baseUrl);
  }
}
----

Make sure the environment variable contains a valid JWT and that the JSON syntax is followed. The base url is available on the `browser.baseUrl` variable.
