Planner can also be run locally using the following alternate ways:

== Minishift
Follow the instructions listed in link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-wit/tree/master/minishift[Running dependent services on OpenShift] to run Planner using Minishift.

== Docker Compose
You can run Planner using Docker Compose as follows:

.Prerequisite
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose set up and the service running in your  system.

.Procedure
. Build the Planner image from source
+
----
docker build -t fabric8-planner-runtime
----
+
. Run the stack with Docker Compose. This runs Planner, Core, DB, Auth & Authâ€™s DB images orchestrated to work together.
+
----
docker-compose up
----
+
IMPORTANT: If wit/core fails to start with `docker-compose up`, run `docker-compose start core` on another terminal. This will continue the `stdout` on the former terminal and the later terminal can be closed after invoking the command.

. Visit http://localhost:8088 on your browser to access the app at this point.
